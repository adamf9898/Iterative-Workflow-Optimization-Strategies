[Repeat structure for each module]

### Workflow Diagram

```
[Create a visual representation of the workflow]
[You can use ASCII art, Mermaid syntax, or reference an external diagram]

Example:
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│ Module 1 │─────>│ Module 2 │─────>│ Module 3 │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
      │                 │                 │
      ↓                 ↓                 ↓
